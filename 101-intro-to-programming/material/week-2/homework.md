# Homework

#### Class 1

1. Create a new git branch called `week-2-class-1` using the command `git checkout -b week-2-class-1`
2. Create a HTML file named `class-1.html` within the `week-2` folder of your repository
3. Add an `input` with the type `text` to your HTML file
4. Give the `input` a unique `id` attribute
5. Add a `button` to your HTML file
6. Give the `button` a unique `id` attribute
7. Create a Javascript file named `class-1.js` within the `week-2` folder of your repository
8. Link to the javascript file using the `script` tag
9. Add a mutable variable named `textValue`
10. Add an event listener to capture when the `button` is clicked
11. Inside the event listener, retrieve the value of the `input` using a query selector
12. Use the `textValue` variable to save the value of the `input`
13. Use an `if` statement to check if the `textValue` is empty
14. If `textValue` is empty, log to the console `Empty`
15. If `textValue` is not empty, log to the console the value stored in `textValue`
16. Create a mutable variable called `clickedCount`, initialized with the nunber `0`
17. Each time the button is clicked, increase the value of `clickedCount` by one
19. Each time `clickedCount` is increased `console.log` the new value
20. Add the files via git
21. Create a new commit with a good message
22. Push the branch to Github
23. Create a Pull Request from your new branch to `master`
